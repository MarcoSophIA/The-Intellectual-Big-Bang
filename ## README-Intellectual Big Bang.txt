## README-Intellectual Big Bang

### What is This?
**Intellectual Big Bang** is an evolving **knowledge graph** that maps intellectual history as a dynamic system. It models books and ideas as **nodes**, with their relationships forming a **network of thought**. This is an **information-space** governed by principles of **relativity, flow, and fractal symmetry**.

### How Does It Work?
- Books are **added dynamically**, forming connections based on **influence, category, and controversy**.
- Some books exert **stronger gravitational pull** due to historical importance or intellectual weight.
- Controversial books **generate heat**, making them reconfigure surrounding knowledge.
- The structure **reshapes itself with each iteration**, mimicking an expanding intellectual universe.

### Key Features:
✅ **Knowledge Gravity** – Core books exert stronger influence.
✅ **Thermodynamic Flow** – Ideas shift and reorganize over time.
✅ **Thought Geodesics** – Find shortest intellectual paths between books.
✅ **Emergent Clustering** – Categories emerge naturally instead of being pre-set.

### How to Use It:
1. **Run the simulation** – Watch the system evolve.
2. **Ask questions** – Find shortest paths, central books, controversial nodes.
3. **Modify weights** – Adjust influence, connectivity, and controversy to test different intellectual landscapes.

### Why This Matters
This is a **living philosophy experiment**, showing how ideas shape and reshape each other over time. It’s not just a static library but a **map of meaning** that grows, shifts, and self-organizes—just like knowledge itself.

### Next Steps:
🚀 Publish open-source for others to explore.
🧠 Refine the system by adding new books and thinkers.
🔍 Use this as a framework to analyze intellectual movements and historical shifts.
